# RAG-Application-for-a-pdf-file
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built with LangChain and Hugging Face’s Mistral-7B model. Uses a university handbook PDF as the knowledge base, enabling users to ask questions and get precise, context-based answers powered by embeddings, Chroma vector store, and LLM integration.
